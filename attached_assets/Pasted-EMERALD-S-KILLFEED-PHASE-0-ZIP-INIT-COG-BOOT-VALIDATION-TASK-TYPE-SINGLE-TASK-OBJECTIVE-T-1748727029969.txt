EMERALD’S KILLFEED — PHASE 0: ZIP INIT + COG BOOT VALIDATION

🎯 TASK TYPE: SINGLE-TASK OBJECTIVE

This is a single atomic task that must be completed as a full uninterrupted operation.
No checkpoints, no commits, no logs until all subtasks pass without errors in production.


---

✅ [PHASE 0] — BOT INIT, ZIP EXTRACTION, & COG BOOTSTRAP

☑️ Required Steps

1. Unzip the uploaded .zip file from the attached_assets directory.

Example: /mnt/data/*.zip

Extract to the root directory

Remove any subdirectory nesting (e.g., project/, src/, Bot/)

Move all files to the true project root

Delete empty folders



2. Ensure Secrets Are Present & Active

Validate .env or Replit secrets environment

Required: BOT_TOKEN, MONGO_URI, RAILWAY_PROD=true or equivalent for production flag



3. Start the bot in production mode

Boot using Replit’s green “Run” button

Wait for full load and monitor logs for:

✅ All cogs loaded

✅ Discord client connected

✅ Command sync complete (or skipped if already present)




4. Validate Cog System

Ensure all cogs (11+) load without error

Confirm that all modules under /cogs/ or /bot/cogs/ are successfully registered

Watch for:

❌ ImportError

❌ SyntaxError

❌ AttributeError

❌ ModuleNotFoundError

❌ Unused or unreferenced cogs




5. Scan for Residual Errors

Watch terminal output after boot for stack traces

If any cogs fail to load:

Isolate the cog

Patch missing imports or broken handlers

Ensure it uses pycord 2.6.1 syntax only (NO discord.py or legacy methods)




6. Rebuild if Needed

If the project doesn’t compile or fails on boot, perform any refactors needed to ensure:

✨ Stable load

✅ No command or cog errors

🔁 No restarts or crash loops

🔒 No dependency mismatches or runtime exceptions






---

📌 COMPLETION CRITERIA

✔ All cogs load successfully
✔ No command or client exceptions in startup
✔ Bot confirms Discord connection and is present in at least one guild
✔ No usage of discord.py, legacy commands, or non-pycord syntax
✔ No console warnings, missing handlers, or cog registration issues
✔ Production flag (RAILWAY_PROD or equivalent) confirmed
✔ All secrets are loaded, and MongoDB is connectable


---

🚨 EXECUTION RULES

Treat this as a single batch task

No outputs, commits, or checkpoints until 100% verification

Do not guess — validate all fixes with code and runtime evidence

Follow pycord 2.6.1 syntax only

If any cog fails to load, stop and correct before continuing

Never alter the environment structure unless necessary for boot

Respect all isolation logic if detected (guild/server-specific paths)
